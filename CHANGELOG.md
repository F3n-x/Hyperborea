# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-10
- Project is now open source under the MIT License.
- Removed the device-pairing license check entirely — the app runs without contacting any server.
- In-app self-update and support-diagnostics upload are now optional, build-time-configurable
  (`server.url` / `r2.base.url`), and disabled by default. They no longer send an auth token.
- Removed the signature self-check and the legacy `system` product flavor / `platform` signing
  config; release builds fall back to the debug signing key when `release.jks` is absent.
- Dropped unused dependencies (BouncyCastle, AndroidX Security-Crypto, ZXing) and the
  `SET_TIME_ZONE` permission.
- Added `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `local.properties.example`.
- No user-facing behavior changes to workout broadcasting (BLE FTMS, WiFi TCP) or device control.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-21
